This repository contains Python code that performs sentiment analysis on product review data from Amazon that predicts whether or not a review is positive or negative.

* Use Pandas dataframes to do feature engineering.
* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.
* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.
* Given a classifier, create a confusion matrix.
* Compare multiple logistic regression models.
